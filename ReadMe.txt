Hello Tweeps, and other visitors from beyond!

I coded this buggy version of Boulderdash in 2009. Not all items placed have a function, and the menu only has the Quit function working.

Keys are
Q or cursor left
W or cursor right
O or cursor up
K or cursor down
R - Restart level
Esc to open/close menu

To access the editor, press Ctrl+Alt+Space when the start screen is showing, and press Enter in game to edit, and return to the game after editing.
Left and right cursor keys select which level of 50 to edit, up and down cursor keys jump levels in 10s.
Any levels you edit will save on Quit.

Oh yes, I knew there was something, after I'd zipped the file, obviously ~ Collect all the sweets to reveal the exit to the next level, and don't get trapped by the mutant dougnuts :) (hey the game was buggy, so that's that!)
